Constructing a system for managing daily events. 
First, create a function that adds an event to a day. 
The output is the day added. Create another function that removes an event from a day, and the output is the day with all its events, excluding the removed event. 
Create another function that lists all events in a day. 
You will loop through the events in the day and return a list of the day and events.
