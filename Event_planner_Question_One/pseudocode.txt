Day Planner
Scenario: Construct a system for managing daily events without specifying the structure for storing data.
The system should allow adding, removing and listing events for any given day.

//Thought process
First create a list of objects that contains days and the events in those days.
Create a function that adds an event to a day by first checking if the day exists in the list of objects.
Create another function that removes an event from a given day by looping through the list of objects and checking for the day.
To list the events in any given day, loop through the list of objects and return each day with it's events.
